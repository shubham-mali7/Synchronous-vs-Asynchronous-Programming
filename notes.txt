This part will be about asynchronous programming 
javascript is single threaded and synchronous programming language

 A pyramid of doom is a block of code that is so nested that you give up trying to mentally digest it. It usually comes in the form of a function within a function within a function within a function of some sort.

 > Prior to promises events and callback functions were used but they had limited functionalities and created unmanageable code. Multiple callback functions would create callback hell that leads to unmanageable code. Also it is not easy for any user to handle multiple callbacks at the same time

 >Promise ek aisi value hai jo hame abhi nahi pata but hume future mai patah hogi
 > promise represent karta hai future value jo hume abhi nahi pata but badme pata chalegi
 > Promise bhi browser ka feature hai toh voh bhi asynchronusly kaam karega 

 > As a javascript developer you will consume more promise as compared to producing a promise

 > resolve , reject , then , catch 

 > Promise add hote hai microtask queue mai   
 >settimeout setinterval vagera callback queue mai add hoti hai

 > callback queue or microtask queue ki comparison mai microtask queue ko jyada priority dee jati hai islea microtask queue pehle execute hota hai 

 >  ye behaviour sabh browsers mai same rehega
